## üìã Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Router** | GL.iNet router with firmware 4.x (including MT-6000 Flint 2 and GL-BE9300 Flint 3) |
| **Free Space** | At least 15 MB (can be bypassed with `--ignore-free-space`) |
| **AdGuard Home** | Pre-installed via GL.iNet firmware (deeply integrated) |

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

Run the updater without cloning the repository:

```bash
wget -O update-adguardhome.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Admonstrator/glinet-adguard-updater/main/update-adguardhome.sh && sh update-adguardhome.sh
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Do not run this script as a cron job! Manual execution is recommended.

---

## üéõÔ∏è Arguments

The `update-adguardhome.sh` script supports the following arguments:

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--ignore-free-space` | Bypasses the free space check and disables backup creation. Use with caution on low-storage devices! ‚ö†Ô∏è Not recommended - could break your router if there's insufficient space! |
| `--select-release` | Displays available releases and lets you choose a specific version to install. |

---

## üìö Usage Examples

### Standard Update

Update to the latest stable release:

```bash
wget -O update-adguardhome.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Admonstrator/glinet-adguard-updater/main/update-adguardhome.sh && sh update-adguardhome.sh
```

### Select a Specific Version

Install a specific AdGuard Home version:

```bash
sh update-adguardhome.sh --select-release
```

The script will display available releases for you to choose from.

### Low Storage Devices

For devices with limited free space (‚ö†Ô∏è use with caution):

```bash
sh update-adguardhome.sh --ignore-free-space
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This disables safety checks and backup creation. Could potentially break your router if there's not enough free space!

---

## üîç Key Features Explained

### üì¶ Tiny-AdGuardHome

By default, the script uses pre-compressed AdGuard Home binaries that:
- üîπ Save significant storage space (6 MB vs 32 MB)
- üîπ Are optimized specifically for GL.iNet routers
- üîπ Maintain full functionality
- üîπ Are recommended for all GL.iNet devices

### üíæ Query Logging

By default, AdGuard Home on GL.iNet routers disables query logging to file to:
- üîπ Prevent running out of storage space
- üîπ Prevent flash memory wear
- üîπ Optimize performance

The script will ask if you want to enable query logging after the update.

#### Manual Query Logging Control

**Enable query logging to file:**

```bash
sed -i '/^querylog:/,/^[^ ]/ s/^  file_enabled: .*/  file_enabled: true/' /etc/AdGuardHome/config.yaml
/etc/init.d/adguardhome restart
```

**Disable query logging to file:**

```bash
sed -i '/^querylog:/,/^[^ ]/ s/^  file_enabled: .*/  file_enabled: false/' /etc/AdGuardHome/config.yaml
/etc/init.d/adguardhome restart
```

### üîÑ Persistence Support

The script offers to make the installation persistent across firmware upgrades by:
- ‚úÖ Adding necessary files to `/etc/sysupgrade.conf`
- ‚úÖ Setting up automatic update checks via `/etc/rc.local`
- ‚úÖ Preserving your AdGuard Home configuration and settings

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Factory reset will NOT revert persistent installations!

---

## üîô Reverting Changes

Since AdGuard Home is deeply integrated into GL.iNet firmware, reverting changes requires manual steps. Factory reset will **NOT** revert changes if you made the installation persistent!

### Manual Revert Steps

1. Remove the update check script from startup:
   ```bash
   sed -i '/enable-adguardhome-update-check/d' /etc/rc.local
   ```

2. Remove the update check script:
   ```bash
   rm /usr/bin/enable-adguardhome-update-check
   ```

3. Remove persistence entries from `/etc/sysupgrade.conf`:
   - `/root/AdGuardHome_backup.tar.gz`
   - `/etc/AdGuardHome`
   - `/usr/bin/AdGuardHome`
   - `/usr/bin/enable-adguardhome-update-check`
   - `/etc/rc.local`

4. Stop AdGuard Home:
   ```bash
   /etc/init.d/adguardhome stop
   ```

5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Reset configuration (removes all settings and blocklists!):**
   ```bash
   rm -rf /etc/AdGuardHome
   ```

6. Start AdGuard Home:
   ```bash
   /etc/init.d/adguardhome start
   ```

### Restore from Backup

A backup of the original files is located at `/root/AdGuardHome_backup.tar.gz` (if created).

If issues persist after manual revert, you can restore AdGuard Home to its original state by re-flashing the firmware.
